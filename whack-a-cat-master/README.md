* It's a simple game, where you need to catch some amount of cats in some time.
* It has 5 levels, which are replaced in turn. They differ in the number of cats you need to catch, time and speed with which the cats jump out.
* You can exit to the main menu at any time of the game, but after that you will start the game again from the first level.
* But if the page reloads at any time during the game, you can continue from the level you left off.
