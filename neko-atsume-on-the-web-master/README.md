# Neko Atsume on the Web | Kristin Ho

Neko Atsume is a collector-style game made by Hit Point for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/neko-atsume-kitty-collector/id923917775?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.co.hit_point.nekoatsume&hl=en). The game's core mechanic is placing toys (known as goodies) and treats (or food) to attract various types of stray cats to your yard. Certain cats are attracted to certain toys when certain foods are out. Rare cats are attracted exclusively to one or two toys and are generally harder to lure.



Neko Atsume on the Web is a mini port of the Neko Atsume game for the browser made using HTML5 Canvas, CSS Transitions, and Javascript. The browser version is non-interactive and is heavily simplified from the original game. Instead, there is a new feature in which your yard reflects the time of day.



Disclaimer: currently rare cats and normal cats have same appearance rates and only one type of cat appears at each spot per toy.
